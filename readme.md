# ShineKit
A project experimenting with implementing support for Cocoa/CocoaTouch in Rust. Also aims to support UWP on Windows by way of Microsoft's Objective-C project.

Highly experimental, wouldn't touch this yet until an actual readme exists... unless you're brave. And enjoy the `unsafe` part of Rust at points.
